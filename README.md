## Introduction

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where each player takes turns marking a cell in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbol (usually 'X' or 'O'). The objective of the game is to be the first to form a line of three of your symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

This project provides a terminal-based implementation of the game in Python, allowing you to play with a friend or challenge yourself against an AI opponent.

## Features

- Player vs Player mode: Play against a friend locally in the terminal.
- Interactive and user-friendly interface.
- Clear display of the game board after each move.
- Input validation to prevent invalid moves.

## How to Play

1. The game board is a 3x3 grid. Players take turns to make a move.
2. Players input their moves by specifying the row and column (e.g., "1 2").
3. The game will display the updated board after each move.
4. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
5. If the entire board is filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
